%% 3- our performance

  We introduce an unsupervised, {\em instance-based} part-of-speech
  induction system that gives state of the art results in 15
  languages.  The system successfully handles highly ambiguous words
  which pose a challenge to {\em word-based} induction systems that
  constrain or strongly bias each word to have a single part-of-speech
  category.  We use probable substitutes of each word instance as
  contextual features.  Words and their contextual, orthographic and
  morphological features are embedded in a high-dimensional Euclidean
  space where distances are used to model their joint distribution.
  To represent a word instance we concatenate its word embedding with
  the average of its contextual feature embeddings.  Our instance
  based system scores 79.5\% many-to-one accuracy on the Penn Treebank
  and achieves results that are significantly better than or
  comparable to the best published systems on 12 out of 19 corpora in
  15 languages.

%%We investigate paradigmatic representations of word context in the
%%domain of unsupervised part of speech induction.  Paradigmatic representations
%%of word context are based on potential substitutes of a word in contrast to
%%syntagmatic representations based on its neighbors.  We model the joint
%%probability of words and their contexts (as represented by potential
%%substitutes) using the S-CODE framework.  S-CODE maps target words, their
%%potential substitutes and other features to high dimensional Euclidean vectors.
%%These vectors aggregate into clusters that largely match the traditional
%%part-of-speech boundaries and give state-of-the-art results in unsupervised
%%part-of-speech induction, including 80\% many-to-one accuracy on the Penn
%%Treebank and statistically significant improvements over best published results
%%on 17 out of 19 corpora in 15 languages.
