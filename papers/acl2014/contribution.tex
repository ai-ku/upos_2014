\section{Contributions}
\label{sec:contrib}
Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item We introduced an instance based POS induction system that can
  handle ambiguous words and is competitive with the word-based systems in
  overall accuracy.  
\item We extended the S-CODE framework to handle more than two categorical
  variables. 
\item Our instance based system scores 79.5\% many-to-one accuracy on
  the Penn Treebank and achieves results that are significantly better
  than or comparable with the best published systems on 12 out of 19
  corpora in 15 languages.
\item All our code and data, including the substitute vectors for the
  PTB, MULTEXT-East and CoNLL-X shared task corpora are available
  at the authors' website at \mbox{\url{xxx.xxx.xxx}}.
\end{itemize}
